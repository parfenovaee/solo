Another week has come to an end. Summer is finally here. This week I finished the last Labs on Operating Systems. These are labs #13 and #14. I also did some rather difficult tasks in Python. Let's talk a little more about that.

**Laboratory work №13**.

The aim of the laboratory work was to obtain the simplest skills in developing, analyzing, testing and debugging applications in UNIX/Linux OS on the example of creating a calculator with simple functions in C programming language.

During this work, I created a rudimentary calculator and worked with it using the gdb debugger. It was quite interesting and informative and improved my skills with the console.

**Laboratory Work №14**

The purpose of this lab work was to gain practical skills working with named channels.

In the course of the work we learned how to run servers. I can't say that this work was easy, but the main difficulty was not in launching channels, but in pre-writing files. But after carefully studying the theory, I managed it.

In Python this week, I learned how to build charts and histograms, which caused a little difficulty. I also wrote a program to read strings from a file and convert them into a dictionary. I found this task to be the most challenging. 

**Conclusion**.

So last week was quite productive and taught me a lot of new things in programming.
