My week was full and productive. In addition to satisfying my personal interests in general, I did four labs, two of which were on Operating Systems. These were labs #5 and #6.

**Lab Work №5**

The lab work was called "Analyzing the Linux File System. Commands for working with files and directories".

Its purpose was to:

- To get acquainted with the Linux file system, its structure, names and contents of directories.
- To gain practical skills in using commands to work with files and directories, managing processes (and jobs), checking disk usage, and maintaining the file system.

During this work, I studied the ***sr*** and ***mv*** commands in detail, remembered the ***cat***, ***touch***,***mkdir*** commands. I also learned what permissions are and how to modify them with the command chmod. Using the man command I learned more about the thermal commands.

**Laboratory Work №6**

The topic of the next lab work was "Finding Files. Redirecting I/O. View running processes".

Purpose of work: getting acquainted with the tools of file search and text data filtering. Gaining practical skills: on managing processes (and tasks), checking disk usage and maintaining file systems.

The lab work helped me learn about I/O streams and how to handle them (for example, redirecting the standard output stream (ls) to the file I needed). Also I learnt how to use the ***find*** and ***grep*** commands, to run background processes, to get information about them and to eliminate them with the ***kill*** command. 

Also, during the last week, I have continued to learn C++ programming language and started to learn a new one which I have never worked with before - Python.

Thus, during the past week I have learned different Linux terminal commands that allow me to work with files and continued to develop my programming skills.
