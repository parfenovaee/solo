This past week has been a productive one. I did several labs again, two of which were steadily on Operating Systems. These were labs #9 and #10. Let me tell you a little bit about them.

**Laboratory Work №9**.

The purpose of the lab work was: 
- To get acquainted with the operating system Linux
- To get practical skills in working with the Emacs editor

In this laboratory work I was introduced to a fairly complex but interesting editor Emacs. I learned how to work with windows and buffers as well as how to edit text using keyboard shortcuts. I liked this editor more than the ones I had previously learned about, because of the variety of its functionality. 

**Laboratory Work №10**.

The goal of the laboratory work was:
- To learn the basics of UNIX/Linux shell programming. 
- To learn how to write small command files.

This lab work was the first in the course where we started programming. It introduced me to the command shell. Through it I learned how to write small scripts that make it easier for the user to work with the operating system. This work was quite interesting. 

I'm still continuing to learn Python in my mathematical modeling course and doing labs on the subject. 

A little bit about the good stuff. Being active outside, especially when the weather is there, is a wonderful thing. You shouldn't forget about it. Especially if with company. Especially if it's a favorite activity.

**Conclusion**.

So, this past week I have been familiarizing myself with the new text editor, writing a few small team files, continuing to program in Python, and remembering to have a good rest.
