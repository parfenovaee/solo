**Report and its structure**.

*Report* - message, report about your actions, work.

The report must contain:
- title page
- work purpose
- task
- work progress
- conclusion

Depending on the specifics of the report, it may also contain a theoretical introduction, an answer to the control questions

The report can be made in any text editor that is available to you. For example, the classic Word or LibreOffice. I am currently doing reports in a Markdown editor, so this is also quite possible. The key is to understand the objectives.

**Components of the report**

*A cover page.* Should contain information about the name of the job for which the report is being written and the person who did the job. 

*Purpose of the work.* This section obviously spells out the purpose (or purposes) of the work that was planned to be achieved.

*Task.* Under this subheading, the task that was to be performed is written. Alternatively, the assignment is written in the course of the work next to each of the numbers. 

*This is the main section of the report. It describes each step by step, carried out in the course of the work. To each of the selected steps attached a screenshot, which clearly shows and proves the performance of the work. This section may also contain other elements, based again on the specifics of the report. For example, program listings, circuit diagrams, inserts from articles, and so on. 

* Conclusion.* This section concludes the report and contains the result of the work performed. Usually the conclusion coincides with the goals of the work. 

**The rules of screenshot design**.

It is important to know how to attach a screenshot to the report correctly. This cannot be done thoughtlessly by simply inserting a picture into the document. 

First of all, in the text of the report you need to specify a link to the required image, i.e. sign the number next to the required sentence. After that, you need to insert a screenshot itself and be sure to write it. The caption includes the number of the figure (was specified earlier) and its title, corresponding to what is happening.  

**Summary**.

In this article we got acquainted with the concept of "report", its structure and design rules.
