I did not notice how this week passed. This time I decided not to delay delivery of the Labs, so I started doing them at the weekend. As a result, at the moment, I did Labs 7 and 8 on Operating Systems and two Labs in C++. I can't say it caused me much difficulty, but it did take some work. Let's talk a little bit about the lab projects on Operating Systems.

**Laboratory work №7**

The purpose of the lab work was to:

- mastering the basic features of the Midnight Commander command shell 
- acquiring practical skills in browsing and manipulating directories and files.

In the course of this work I became well acquainted with Midnight Commander. I studied its structure and menus and performed many operations using only the control keys. The second assignment of the laboratory work taught me how to work with the text editor mc.


**Laboratory work №8**.

The purpose of the lab work was to:
- to get acquainted with the Linux operating system 
- get practical skills in working with the editor vi, which is installed by default in almost all distributions.

This laboratory work taught me how to use the text editor vi and introduced me to its main modes and how to use them. Thanks to it I learned the basic hotkeys for performing many editing operations.

**Conclusion**.

So, over the past week I have learned to use the Midnight Commander shell and the common editor vi, and learned how to perform various operations with them. I continued to develop in C++ programming and did not forget about recreation.
