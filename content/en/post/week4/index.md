My week was full and productive. I did several labs (this time there were more than usual), two of which were on Operating Systems. These were labs #11 and #12. Let's talk a little bit about them.

**Lab work №11**.

The purpose of the work was: 

- To learn the basics of UNIX shell programming. 

- To learn how to write more complex command files using logical control structures and loops.

This lab work was quite complicated, so it took a long time to complete. During it I wrote 4 command files designed to perform different tasks.

**Laboratory Work №12**.

The purpose of the work was: 
- To learn the basics of UNIX shell programming.

- To learn how to write more complex command files using logical control structures and loops.

In this lab work, I wrote three command files, one of which implemented the man command. I also learned how to use the built-in RANDOM variable.

Very interesting was the Lab work on mathematical modeling, where we program in Python. It took me quite a long time, but I got it done, correcting errors that appeared along the way. During the course of the work, I learned quite a few new functions and methods, as well as new approaches to solving problems.

**Conclusion**.

Thus, over the past week I have improved my shell programming skills, as well as learned much more about Python syntax.
